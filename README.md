# sam-crud-sample
This project has been initiated with the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) command line interface (CLI).  

It includes the following files and folders:  
- `src` - JS code for the application's Lambda functions.
- `events` - Invocation events that you can use to invoke the function.
- `__tests__` - Unit tests for the application code. 
- `template.yaml` - A template that defines the application's AWS resources.

The application uses several AWS resources, including Lambda functions, an API Gateway API, and Amazon DynamoDB tables. These resources are defined in the `template.yaml` file in this project.  

## Deploy the sample application
To use the AWS SAM CLI, you need the following tools:
* AWS SAM CLI - [Install the AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html).
* Node.js - [Install Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/en/), including the npm package management tool.
* Docker - [Install Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community).

To build and deploy your application for the first time, run the following in your shell:
```bash
$ sam build
$ sam deploy
```

The first command will build the source of your application. The second command will package and deploy your application.
The API Gateway endpoint API will be displayed in the outputs when the deployment is complete.

## Use the AWS SAM CLI to build and test locally
Build your application by using the `sam build` command.
```bash
$ sam build
$ sam local invoke putItemFunction --event events/event-post-item.json
$ sam local invoke getAllItemsFunction --event events/event-get-all-items.json
```

The AWS SAM CLI installs dependencies that are defined in `package.json`, creates a deployment package, and saves it in the `.aws-sam/build` folder.
Test a single function by invoking it directly with a test event. An event is a JSON document that represents the input that the function receives f  rom the event source. Test events are included in the `events` folder in this project.
Run functions locally and invoke them with the `sam local invoke` command.

If you experience issues check your target architecture in the Parameters section (ex. arm64 for MacOS silicon) and signout from the public ecr repository (ie. docker logout public.ecr.aws).  

The AWS SAM CLI can also emulate your application's API. Use the `sam local start-api` command to run the API locally on port 3000.
```bash
$ sam local start-api
$ curl http://localhost:3000/
```

The AWS SAM CLI reads the application template to determine the API's routes and the functions that they invoke. The `Events` property on each function's definition includes the route and method for each path.

```yaml
      Events:
        Api:
          Type: Api
          Properties:
            Path: /
            Method: GET
```

## Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs
To simplify troubleshooting, the AWS SAM CLI has a command called `sam logs`. `sam logs` lets you fetch logs that are generated by your Lambda function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly find the bug.

```bash
$ sam logs -n putItemFunction --stack-name sam-app --tail
```

## Unit tests
Tests are defined in the `__tests__` folder in this project. Use `npm` to install the [Jest test framework](https://jestjs.io/) and run unit tests.
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run test
```

## Cleanup
To delete the sample application that you created, use the AWS CLI. Assuming you used your project name for the stack name, you can run the following:
```bash
$ sam delete --stack-name sam-crud-sample
```

## Todo
- Auth0 integration 
  - API GW custom authorizers
    - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-use-lambda-authorizer.html
    - https://auth0.com/docs/customize/integrations/aws/aws-api-gateway-custom-authorizers  
- hard delete if admin role
- get_all with consistent pagination
  - proper scan with filter and global index
  - return and accept a pagination parameters (ie. page size, key)
- webSocket API
